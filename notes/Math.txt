d[S]/dt = Sum_{rxn in CRN}(k(rxn)*netChange(S,rxn)) *Product_{R in reactant}([R]^{mrxn(R)})
The right side is a sum over reactions in the CRN, where
k(rxn) is a rate of reaction rxn, netChange(S,rxn) is a net
change of molecules of S upon triggering of rxn (can be
negative), and mrxn(R) is the multiplicity of reactant R in
reaction rxn.
